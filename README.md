I'm **Gabriel, a CS student** in Los Angeles. Currently, I'm studying machine learning, biomedical engineering and software engineering.

Swift is my primary language, both on Linux and macOS. I dabble with Rust and have used Crystal, JavaScript, and Python.
<br>I love learning languages, both programming and natural, so I'd love any tips/lessons on languages you're passionate about!
